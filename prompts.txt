The purpose of this project is to create an experiment that shows causal evidence for the decision transfromer I have trained to play DoorKey8x8 uses a concept of "has-key" when it is making its decisions. This is
based on research from 2023 from jsbloom, and his DecisionTransformerInterpetability repo is inside my project as a local library to pull wrappers and tools from that might make this easier. I have so far trained a
 PPO policy to create a dataset of 10,000 trajectories (inside the data folder) which are then used to train a decision transfromer that is copied from the jsbloom code. This trained transfromer is inside
dt_dti_flat.pth and creating this was the first stage of the project, which I have now completed. The second stage of the project is to use jsblooms work on adapting transformer lens for decision transfromers to
handle dt_dti_flat.pth, hook it into transformer lens and then use an updated version of tl (2.15.0) to build on the research from 2023 that jsbloom did now that we have more powerful tools at our disposal in the
new transformer lens library. I have a file called sanity_checks that runs online and offline tests on the decsiion transfomer I have trained to ensure it is performing correctly, and records a video of an online
run for demo purposes. I am now working in 01_probe_has_key.ipynb to try and hook into the decision transformer I have trained using jsblooms wrappers and then set it up to start performing the necessary
experiments I would like to to get the result I am working towards - causal proof of a "has-key" concept. I am a beginner to mechinterp so this stage is proving difficult, and is where I would like help
proceeeding. Please can you look through my project and help me untangle where I should be using jsbloom's code, and where I should be trying to use tl 2.15.0 towards the end I have expressed. I would like you to
help me write the code needed for th experiment I am trying to do, using all of the useful transformer lens content so I don't reivent the wheel, and continually test the code I am running so that the output shows
I am going in the right direction. I am now working in 01_probe_has_key.ipynb and this is where I would like you to help me progress. If you see changes that should be made in other files to help improve the
outcome of this process, please also make this known and give me your suggestions. Thank you!
